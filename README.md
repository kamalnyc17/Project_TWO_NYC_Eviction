# NYC Evictions Analysis 
## Visualize trends related to evictions in NYC between the years 2017-2019 on an interactive dashboard.

This dashboard seeks to look at NYC eviction data between the years 2017-2019. Visualizations are based on data extracted from the [City of New York website (NYC Open Data)] (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Evictions/6z8x-wfk4). Because of COVID-19 and a moratorium on evictions from mid-March 2020 through October 1, there was no data for at least half of the year 2020. Despite this, our team decided to continue analyzing eviction data from 2017-2019 to see if there are any trends we can uncover. 
 
When tenants are for any reason not paying their rent or are otherwise not legally occupying their apartment, landlords can mount a nonpayment or holdover eviction proceeding against them and bring them to housing court. In NYC, housing courts in all boroughs are usually filled with frenzied landlords, tenants, lawyers, and housing court and community organization officials. Pre COVID-19, evictions and housing court cases were in full swing as regularly scheduled programming. But during this unprecedented time of a global pandemic, in mid-March 2020, Governor Andrew Cuomo issued a moratorium on evictions. Now, residential tenants cannot be evicted through October 1.
